## GameApp
This is an English Grammar learning android application runs on the Pepper humanoid robot 

# Notes and Ideas:
goal is to have the robot speak out every question instead of just having it on the screen.
    maybe try giving ever question its own activity?
when calling question() go with the Focus to Another Activity and Read the question in there. And then give back the Focus.
